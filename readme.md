## Creating a Pull Request

3. Once forking is done loading, click on the green `clone or download` button and copy the link. Make sure it is your repository in the upper left hand corner.
4. Open Git in your desired location for the folder by right clicking and clicking on `Git Bash Here`. Make sure you know where you're saving your folder.
